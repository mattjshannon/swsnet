Hi Christian:

Try guest ... zippy4prez

The latter is a reference to Zippy the Pinhead and his
occasional campaigns for President.

One major caveat for the data - for fainter sources, we
switched from multiplicative corrections to remove
discontinuities between spectral segments to additive
corrections, and in hindsight, this was probably not a
good idea.  Some of the fainter spectra are just screwed
due to hysteresis effects, and neither correction solves
the problem, but in some of those spectra, the multiplicative
correction would still have been preferable.

The header information tells you.  In the ASCII files, the
second row contains 12 single-digit numbers, which are "0"
for multiplicative and "1" for additive.  The 1's require
a bit more caution.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Greg
