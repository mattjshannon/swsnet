convert_fits_to_csv.py

Convert (batch) SWS .fits files to csv.

Note: I think dframe['wave'] is duplicated (identically) for all dframes,
      may want to remove later.
Note: CSV dframes use a lot more space than FITS. Not sure what format we
      want the data in for the neural network...?
Note: Not sure yet what to do with the header.
